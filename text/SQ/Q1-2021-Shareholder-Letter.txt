 2Highlights
In the first quarter of 2021, total net revenue was $5.06 billion, up 266% year over year, and, excluding bitcoin revenue, total net revenue was $1.55 billion, up 
44% year over year.
In the first quarter of 2020, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA were significantly affected by an increase in provisions for transaction and loan losses as a 
result of the anticipated impact of COVID-19.
The following items affected net income (loss) per share during the respective periods. In the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of $21 million 
related to observable price changes for non-marketable equity investments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of $274 million related to 
equity investments, driven primarily by a gain of $255 million as a result of the mark-to-market valuation of our investment in DoorDash. In the first quarter of 
2021, we recognized a loss of $29 million related to the mark-to-market valuation of our investment in DoorDash as well as a $20 million bitcoin impairment.

We delivered strong growth at scale during the first quarter of 2021. Gross 
profit grew 79% year over year to $964 million. In our Seller ecosystem, 
gross profit was up 32% year over year in the first quarter. Our Cash App

As a company, we continue to believe our purpose of economic empowerment 
is more important than ever. This quarter, we again participated in the Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP), enabling us to uplift many of the businesses most 
in need through forgivable loans. As the macroeconomic environment remains 
uncertain, we are focused on helping our sellers and individuals thrive for the 
long term. To help support individuals, we made government disbursements 
available to customers through Cash App and facilitated payments to customers 
up to two days early. For each of our Seller and Cash App ecosystems, we 
remain encouraged by the opportunity to reach new audiences by increasing 
our investments in customer acquisition and product innovation, especially 
as regions in the U.S. and international markets begin to reopen.

 ECOSYSTEM
Enhancing our ecosystem of products We continued to build upon our omnichannel 
capabilities by launching Square Messages, a 
new feature that helps sellers interact with their 
buyers more effectively through text message 
or email. Instead of making a phone call, a hair 
stylist can simply check in with new clients within seconds through a message or hear from a 
customer who may be running late. Nine out of ten consumers expressed interest in messaging businesses directly, and we believe Square 
Messages will help sellers build more meaningful relationships with their buyers, which has become increasingly important in an omnichannel world.¹We have played a crucial role in helping sellers 
access government funding during the pandemic. 
In February, we began participating in the current 
round of the PPP to support small businesses 
that have been affected by COVID-19. In the first 
quarter, Square Capital facilitated $531 million in 
PPP loans, providing access to a financial lifeline 
to more than 57,000 small businesses. In keeping 
with our purpose of economic empowerment, we 
helped reach sellers who are typically overlooked 
by traditional financial institutions: During the 
first quarter, the vast majority of our PPP loans 
were distributed to sellers with fewer than five 
employees. We see a meaningful opportunity 
to expand access to banking products for small 
businesses, and we opened our bank, Square 
Financial Services, in March to pursue this effort. 
Growing upmarketOur ecosystem of products continued to support 
growth of larger sellers. In the first quarter, mid-market Seller GPV grew 43% year over year, more 
than 2x the growth of total Seller GPV. With our 
increase in sales and marketing investments, we 
see an opportunity to continue driving awareness 
of our broader ecosystem among larger sellers.Square Messages is 
accessible from sellers™

$66 million on an annualized

online order management. 
Square for Retail
 is an all-in-one retail point

inventory, vendor, and customer relationship 
management, and online order management. 
Our vertical point-of-sale software has attracted new and larger sellers to Square. In the first quarter, 
more than half of Square for Restaurants and Square 
for Retail sellers onboarded were new to Square. Restaurants and retailers value the cohesion of Square™s ecosystem to help them manage their businesses efficiently, and have adopted more than three products on average.¹ These sellers have used 
more of our broader ecosystem and generated gross profit of more than 5x greater compared to the average seller. We have seen encouraging momentum from Square for Restaurants and 
Square for Retail: Overall gross profit from sellers 
using these products was nearly $140 million on an 
annualized basis during the first quarter, doubling year over year.² 
Expanding globally 
Strengthening our international presence remains 
a key priority for our Seller ecosystem, and we are 
focused on achieving product parity globally. In the 
first quarter, we launched Square Terminal in Japan, 
as well as Square Register in both the U.K. and 
Australia, to enable more contactless commerce 
experiences and attract larger sellers. We also 
introduced Square Appointments in the U.K. to 
help sellers accept online bookings. As we grow 
upmarket, we believe these versatile products will 
attract larger businesses with more complex needs. During the first quarter, despite strict lockdowns around the world, Seller gross profit in our 
international markets grew nearly 80% year over 
year and represented 8% of Seller gross profit. We see an opportunity to further scale globally as we 
continue expanding our software and financial 
services offerings. In Australia, our largest 
international market, gross profit doubled year 
over year in the first quarter due primarily to 
strong acquisition of new sellers and continued 
growth upmarket.SQUARE

 ECOSYSTEM
Strengthening the networkWe are focused on strengthening our network by reaching new audiences and creating 
differentiated experiences across our products. 
In the first quarter, we continued to scale our 
marketing efforts to bring in new customers, 
increase adoption, and drive engagement for 
existing customers. In March, Cash App began 
offering customers the ability to instantly send 
bitcoin for free. Customers can send bitcoin to 
friends and family all within Cash App instead 
of leaving the platform or locating an individual 
bitcoin wallet addressŠa unique intersection 
of our bitcoin and peer-to-peer functionality. 
Since launch, we have seen the feature drive 
early adoption by existing customers as well 
as attract new customers to bitcoin, drawing 
upon the network effects in peer to peer. 
As we grow our Seller and Cash App ecosystems, 
we believe the opportunities for connections 
between them become more compelling. In the 
first quarter, we integrated Square Loyalty into 
Cash App to serve as a flywheel for seller and 
buyer discovery, engagement, and retention. 
Once customers complete a purchase from a 
seller using Square Loyalty, they receive a text 
message with a link to open or download Cash 
App, where they can view and manage rewards in 
a centralized place. By reaching any buyer using 
Square Loyalty, we believe this seamless integration 
will help bring new customers into Cash App while 
also deepening the seller-buyer connection. 
 Driving engagementWe have seen a strong relationship between 
product adoption and greater engagement with 
our ecosystem. Cash Card has the greatest scale 
of any Cash App product, reaching more than 
10 million monthly Cash Card actives in March. 
Customers have used their card for everyday 
purchases, including food, transportation services, 
and at major retailers, and have transacted 
more frequently over time: In March, 7 million 
Cash Card customers transacted on a weekly 
basis on average, nearly doubling year over year 
as we have seen monthly actives increasingly 
become weekly actives. As engagement has 
grown, so has spendŠin the first quarter, spend 
through Cash Card was up approximately 2.5x 
compared to the prior year and the majority of 
weekly actives transacted multiple times per 
week. Cash Card has served as an entry point 
into our broader ecosystem, as Cash Card actives 
adopted nearly twice the number of products 
as non-Cash Card actives in the first quarter. 
Square Loyalty + Cash App
This integration allows us to bring commerce to Cash App 
via Square™s vast network of sellers and buyers.

 Q1 2021
 7Spending power drove growth in MarchA primary driver of Cash App™s gross profit 
growth has been inflows, or the amount of 
money our customers pull into Cash App. In 
2021, a top strategic priority for Cash App is to 
make it easier for customers to bring funds into 
the ecosystem, which we have seen ultimately 
helps drive engagement. Customers can fund 
their Cash App accounts in a variety of waysŠsuch as adding cash from their primary bank 
account and receiving a peer-to-peer transfer.  
When the spending power of our customers 
increases, we have seen them pull funds into Cash 
App to use across our ecosystem. In March, Cash 
App experienced a significant increase in inflows 
as customers brought approximately 55% more 
funds into our ecosystem compared to February, 
driven primarily by an increase in government 
disbursements. While we saw an uplift in direct 
deposit volumes in mid-March, inflows from all 
other sources combined were significantly greater, 
as customers pulled more funds into Cash App in the weeks following. These funds are being used across our ecosystem for many different needs: 
Among peer-to-peer payments sent between 
customers, top use cases included critical needs 
such as rent, car payments, and utility bills. 
In March, Cash App experienced a significant increase of 
inflows from individuals™ greater spending power related to 
government disbursements.
Customers can fund their Cash App accounts with 
inflows
 in 
a variety of ways: Peer-to-peer transfers, transactions on 
bitcoin or stocks, cash added from a debit card or bank 
account into a Cash App balance, and through direct 
deposits including recurring paychecks or one-time deposits.

In the first quarter of 2021, our Seller ecosystem 
generated $1.02 billion of revenue and $468 million 
of gross profit, up 19% and 32% year over year, 
respectively.In the first quarter of 2021, Seller generated 
$868 million of transaction-based revenue, up 
19% year over year. We saw continued strong 
growth in online channels and international 
markets, as well as improving recovery in the 
U.S. supported by regional reopenings and 
government disbursements. During the quarter, 
transaction-based gross profit for our Seller 
ecosystem benefited from a higher percentage 
of debit card transactions, a higher proportion 
of card-not-present volumes, and an increase 
in average transaction size on a year-over-year basis. We recognize that these trends are 
elevated relative to historical periods partly as 
a result of changes to consumer behaviors due 
to COVID-19 and government disbursements, 
which may not continue in future quarters.        
In the first quarter of 2021, we achieved positive gross profit retention driven by regional 
reopenings and government disbursements, as well as lapping the impact of COVID-19 in March 2020. We experienced a notable recovery in March 
of 2021, as GPV from existing cohorts returned 
nearly to their March 2019 volumes, with each 
existing annual cohort exhibiting a similar trend. 
We saw particular strength from recently acquired 
cohorts, which had a greater mix of larger sellers. 
During the first quarter of 2021, Seller GPV was 
up 20% year over year. Year-over-year Seller 
GPV growth was relatively consistent in January and February, up 5% excluding the impact 
of leap year, before improving in March. In 
March, growth improved as a result of regional 
reopenings, government disbursements related 
to stimulus programs, and lapping the impact 
of COVID-19 in March 2020. Looking at the 
components of Seller GPV, we observed the 
following trends during the first quarter of 2021.¹Ł  Products: Card-not-present GPV was up 34% year over year, driven by growth from our online channels, including Square Online, Invoices, Virtual Terminal, and eCommerce API. Card-present GPV achieved positive growth, up 13% year over year. Regional trends in card-present volumes depended on changes to local reopening measures, among other factors. We use gross profit 
retention to measure our 
ability to help our sellers 
grow over time.
Gross profit retention 
 rate
 is calculated as the 
year-over-year gross profit 
growth of a quarterly seller 
cohort, averaged over the 
last four quarters (excluding 
gross profit from hardware, 
Square Gift Cards, Caviar, 
and Weebly prior to the 
acquisition). For example, 
retention for our 2019 
cohort is the average annual 
gross profit growth from 
sellers onboarded in 2019. 
We do not include hardware 
or Square Gift Cards 
because they are typically 
non-recurring in nature, and 
we view hardware as an 
acquisition tool and not a 
profit center for our 
business. A seller cohort 
represents the new sellers 
onboarded to Square 
during a given period.

 10We began facilitating access 
to PPP loans in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and PPP loans were not 
 part of the ordinary course 
of operations for Square 
Capital prior to 2020. 
Future PPP loans or similar 
government programs will 
depend on government 
action and, at this time, we 
do not know to what extent 
these types of programs 
will continue, if at all.  
For PPP loans sold to an 
institutional third-party 
investor, we shared 
economics with the 
investor, recognized the 
majority of revenue upon 
the sale, and deferred 
a portion allocated to 
servicing obligations. 
For PPP loans held on 
our balance sheet, we 
retained a greater portion 
of the economics, which 
we intend to recognize as 
revenue over the life of 
the loan. We earned lower 
revenue on PPP loans 
compared to core flex loans.
Hardware is sold primarily 
as an acquisition tool, and 
generating positive gross 
margins from hardware 
sales is not the primary goal 
of the hardware business. 
Ł  Geographies: Our largest U.S. metropolitan areas experienced a greater improvement in Seller GPV compared to the rest of the U.S., primarily as a result of regional reopenings. These metros had experienced a more pronounced impact to growth in prior quarters due to regional restrictions. Our international markets achieved strong Seller GPV growth year over year during the first quarter despite periodic regional lockdowns affecting in-person activity, with particular strength from Australia and Canada.Seller generated $121 million of subscription and 
services-based revenue during the first quarter of 
2021, up 18% year over year. Seller subscription 
and services-based revenue from products other 
than Square Capital grew 38% year over year in the 
first quarter.   
Ł  Square Capital: Square Capital facilitated approximately 136,000 loans in the first quarter of 2021, totaling $923 million, up 68% year over year. PPP loans totaled $531 million across more than 57,000 loans. Flex loans totaled $392 million across more than 78,000 loans, with volumes down year over year: After pausing flex loan offers from early March to late July of 2020, we have been measured in our ongoing ramp of offers to sellers. Revenue from Square Capital was down on a year-over-year basis due to a lower mix of flex loans during the quarter. Ł Software subscriptions and Square Card delivered strong growth during the quarter, outpacing overall Seller gross profit growth. Software subscription growth benefited from lapping the impact from refunding sellers™ subscription fees for the month of March 2020 due to the onset of COVID-19.   Hardware revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was $29 million, up 39% year over year, and generated a gross loss of $12 million. Revenue growth was driven 
by strong unit sales across nearly all of our hardware 
product offerings, with particular strength in Square 
Register, which launched in the U.K. and Australia, as well as Square Terminal, which launched in Japan.SQUARE

 EXPENSES
Operating expenses were $896 million in the first quarter of 2021, up 42% year over year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $732 million, up 38% year over year.Product development expenses were $309 million on 
a GAAP basis and $204 million on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2021, up 58% and 63% year over 
year, respectively, driven primarily by headcount and 
personnel costs related to our engineering, data science, and design teams. Sales and marketing expenses were $349 million on a 
GAAP basis and $337 million on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2021, both up 80% year over year. Ł Cash App marketing expenses were up 94% year over year, driven primarily by increases in peer-to-peer transactions and related 
transaction losses, Cash Card issuances, 
advertising, and referrals and incentives. Ł Other sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, personnel, and other costs, were up 59% year over year as we increased sales and marketing spend for our Seller ecosystem, including performance marketing, brand and awareness marketing, and sales headcount. General and administrative expenses were $196 million on a GAAP basis and $170 million on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2021, up 51% and 53% year over year, respectively. The increase was due primarily to additions to customer support, finance, legal, and compliance personnel.Transaction and loan loss expenses were $20 million in the first quarter of 2021, down 81% year over year and up 25% quarter over quarter. During the first 
quarter, we released provisions for transaction 
losses related to the fourth quarter of 2020, although 
overall expenses still decreased on a year-over-year basis due to the significant increase in provisions built during the prior-year period due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Given the variability of potential outcomes 
related to the macro environment, actual realized 
losses may differ materially from our estimates for provisions. Transaction and loan loss expenses 
related to Cash App increased year over year, driven by Cash App™s strong growth during the quarter.In the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 
2021, we invested $50 million and $170 million, 
respectively, in bitcoin. As an indefinite-lived 
intangible asset, bitcoin is subject to impairment 
losses if the fair value of bitcoin decreases below 
the carrying value during the assessed period. 
In the first quarter, we recognized a bitcoin 
impairment loss of $20 million on our bitcoin 
investment. As of March 31, 2021, the fair value of 
our investment in bitcoin was $472 million based 
on observable market prices, which is $272 million 
greater than the carrying value of the investment. 
Each quarter, we estimate 
transaction losses that 
may materialize in future 
periods related to that 
quarter™s volume. These 
estimates are typically 
based on predictive data 
scienceŒbased models, 
which historically have 
been close to future actual 
realized losses.
The accounting rules for 
bitcoin will require us to 
recognize any decreases in 
market price below carrying 
value as an impairment 
charge, with no upward 
revisions recognized when 
the market price increases 
until the sale of that bitcoin. 
The bitcoin impairment loss 
is a GAAP expense. 
Non-GAAP operating 
expenses exclude bitcoin 
impairment losses. 
We offer the peer-to-peer 
service free to our Cash 
App customers, and we 
consider it to be a marketing 
tool to encourage the use 
of Cash App.

 13EARNINGS
In the first quarter of 2021, net income was 
$39 million. Net income was $88 million when 
excluding losses of $29 million related to our 
investment in DoorDash and $20 million related 
to the impairment of our bitcoin investment. Net income per share was $0.09 and $0.08 on a basic 
and diluted basis, respectively, in the first quarter 
of 2021, based on 455 million weighted-average 
basic shares and 501 million weighted-average 
diluted shares. Excluding the losses from our 
investments in DoorDash and bitcoin, basic and diluted net income per share in the first quarter of 2021 was $0.19 and $0.17, respectively. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $236 million in the first 
quarter of 2021, compared to $9 million in the 
first quarter of 2020. The increase in Adjusted 
EBITDA compared to the prior-year period 
was driven by gross profit growth across our 
Seller and Cash App ecosystems, as well as 
a release of $29 million in existing provisions 
for transaction losses in our Seller business 
related to the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding 
this release of existing provisions during the 
quarter, Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million. 
Adjusted Net Income Per Share (Adjusted 
EPS) was $0.41 on a diluted basis based on 
525 million weighted-average diluted shares 
for the first quarter of 2021, representing 
a $0.43 improvement year over year. 
The following items affected net income (loss) per share 
during the respective periods. In the first quarter of 2021, we 
recognized a loss of $29 million related to our investment in 
DoorDash as well as a $20 million bitcoin impairment. In the 
fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a gain of $274 million 
related to equity investments, driven primarily by a gain of 
$255 million as a result of the mark-to-market valuation of 
our DoorDash investment. In the second quarter of 2020, we 
recognized a gain of $21 million related to observable price 
changes for non-marketable equity investments. See below 
for a discussion of items that impacted net loss and Adjusted 
EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020.

 FLOW
We ended the first quarter of 2021 with $4.8 billion 
in available liquidity, with $4.3 billion in cash, cash 
equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in 
marketable debt securities, as well as $500 million 
available to be withdrawn from our revolving 
 credit facility. 
In the first quarter of 2021, Adjusted EBITDA, net proceeds from the PPPLF advances, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options contributed positively to our cash balance. This was offset by cash outflows due to purchases of bitcoin and other investments, the timing of purchases of property and equipment, and payments for tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units. In February 2021, we invested $170 million in 
bitcoin as we believe cryptocurrencies are an 
instrument of economic empowerment, which 
aligns with the company™s purpose. We expect 
to hold this investment for the long term. 
In April 2021, we completed the acquisition of a 
significant majority ownership stake in TIDAL, 
a global music and entertainment platform, for 
an aggregate consideration of $302 million. 
The acquisition extends Square™s purpose of 
economic empowerment to music artists.

 TRENDS
Seller ecosystemŁ In April, Seller delivered strong gross profit growth year over year. Seller GPV was up 144% year over 
year in April. The two-year compound annual growth rate for Seller GPV in April was 21%, which was 
relatively consistent with March. In April, GPV growth improved compared to year-over-year results in 
the first quarter, driven primarily by regional reopenings, government fund disbursements, and lapping 
the impact of COVID-19 starting in late March of 2020. 
Ł We saw continued strength in GPV from our online channels as well as an improvement in in-person 
activity, which benefited from regional reopenings. GPV growth trends continued to vary by region, 
product, and vertical, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings. 
Cash App ecosystemŁ In April, Cash App delivered strong gross profit growth year over year. As we lapped the government 
fund disbursements in mid-April of 2020, gross profit growth slowed year over year. 
Ł We achieved strong engagement across products in our Cash App ecosystem. Gross profit growth also benefited from customers pulling more funds into their Cash App accounts in late March and early April, which was driven partly by direct and indirect inflows from the disbursements of government funds. 
Growth comparisons: Looking ahead to the remainder of 2021, we believe two-year compound annual 
growth rates from 2019 through 2021 will help reflect underlying gross profit trends in each ecosystem. 
In the second quarter of 2021, Cash App will lap strong gross profit growth of 167% year over year in the 
second quarter of 2020 as government disbursements began in April 2020. On the other hand, in the 
second quarter of 2021, Seller gross profit growth will benefit, given that gross profit declined 9% year 
over year in the second quarter of 2020 due to significant regional restrictions affecting in-person activity.April Trends and 
 Forward-Looking Commentary
Given the uncertainty around the impact and severity of COVID-19, we wanted to provide an update on the trends in our business during the month of April. All growth comparisons for April 2021 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified.
The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the mean annual growth rate over a specified time period.

We believe our Cash App and Seller ecosystems are well-positioned to help our customers adapt in a very 
dynamic environment, based on trends we have observed during recent quarters. We intend to prioritize 
investments in our Cash App and Seller ecosystems that we believe will help drive attractive long-term returns. 
For the second quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP product development, sales and marketing, and 
general and administrative expenses, in aggregate, to increase by approximately $120 million compared to 
the first quarter of 2021, on a dollar basis. 
For the full year of 2021, we expect non-GAAP product development, sales and marketing, and general 
and administrative expenses, in aggregate, to increase by approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion 
compared to the full year of 2020, representing growth of 50% year over year at the midpoint.Transaction and loan losses: In the second quarter of 2021, we expect transaction and loan loss expense 
to increase by approximately $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Given the variability of 
potential outcomes related to the growth of our business and the macro environment, actual realized 
losses may differ materially from our estimates for provisions, depending on a number of factors, including 
the length and severity of the impact from COVID-19. 
Share-based compensation: We intend on continuing to invest in building out our teams, including attracting, 
hiring, and retaining talented employees. In the second quarter of 2021, we expect the quarter-over-quarter 
growth in our share-based compensation expense to be greater than the 2020 year period and comparable to 
the 2019 year period. These share-based compensation expenses are not included in the aforementioned 
non-GAAP product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. 
We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for certain forward-looking non-GAAP operating expenses or a 
GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as share-
based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP 
equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling 
items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided a reconciliation of other GAAP to non-GAAP 
metrics in tables at the end of this letter.

 OPERATING
 METRICS
 AND
 NON
-GAAP
 FINANCIAL
 MEASURES
TTo supplement our financial information presented in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the United States (GAAP), we consider certain operating 
and financial measures that are not prepared in accordance 
with GAAP, including Gross Payment Volume (GPV), Adjusted 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income 
(Loss), Diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
(Adjusted EPS), and non-GAAP operating expenses as well 
as other measures defined in the shareholder letter such as 
measures excluding bitcoin revenue, bitcoin impairment loss, 
measures excluding gains or losses on equity investments, 
and measures excluding release of transaction loss reserves. 
We believe these metrics and measures are useful to 
facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business and 
to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of other 
payments solution providers. 
We define GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments 
processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. Additionally, 
GPV includes Cash App activity related to Cash for Business 
and to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net 
Income (Loss), and Diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per 
Share (Adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures 
that represent our net income (loss) and net income (loss) 
per share, adjusted to eliminate the effect of share-based 
compensation expenses; amortization of intangible assets; 
gain or loss on revaluation of equity investments; bitcoin 
impairment loss; the gain or loss on the disposal of property 
and equipment; and impairment of intangible assets, as 
applicable. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2020-06 on 
January 1, 2021, we also adjusted to eliminate the effect 
of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs on 
our convertible senior notes, and the gain or loss on debt 
extinguishment related to the conversion of senior notes. 
Subsequent to the adoption, we adjusted to eliminate 
the effect of amortization of debt issuance costs on our 
convertible senior notes. We also exclude certain costs 
associated with acquisitions and other activities that are not 
normal recurring operating expenses, including amounts paid 
to redeem acquirees™ unvested stock-based compensation 
awards, and legal, accounting, and due diligence costs, and 
we add back the impact of the acquired deferred revenue 
and deferred cost adjustment, which was written down to fair 
value in purchase accounting. Additionally, for purposes of 
calculating diluted Adjusted EPS, we add back cash interest 
expense on convertible senior notes, as if converted at the 
beginning of the period, if the impact is dilutive. In addition 
to the items above, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial 
measure that also excludes depreciation and amortization, 
interest income and expense, other income and expense, 
and provision or benefit from income taxes, as applicable. To 
calculate the diluted Adjusted EPS, we adjust the weighted-
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for 
the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock. In 
periods when we recorded an Adjusted Net Loss, the diluted 
Adjusted EPS is the same as basic Adjusted EPS because the 
effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive given 
the Adjusted Net Loss position. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial 
measure that represents operating expenses adjusted 
to remove the impact of share-based compensation, 
depreciation and amortization, bitcoin impairment loss, loss 
on disposal of property and equipment, and acquisition-
related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as 
Adjusted EBITDA divided by gross profit. 
We have included Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, and 
non-GAAP operating expenses because they are key 
measures used by our management to evaluate our 
operating performance, generate future operating plans, 
and make strategic decisions, including those relating to 
operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. 
Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted 
EPS, and non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful 
information to investors and others in understanding and 
evaluating our operating results in the same manner as 
our management and board of directors. In addition, they 
provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons 
of our business, as they remove the effect of certain non-
cash items and certain variable charges. We have included 
measures excluding bitcoin revenue because our role is to 
facilitate customers™ access to bitcoin. When customers 
buy bitcoin through Cash App, we only apply a small margin 
to the market cost of bitcoin, which tends to be volatile 
and outside our control. Therefore, we believe deducting 
bitcoin revenue better reflects the economic benefits as 
well as our performance from these transactions. We have 
included measures excluding gains or losses on equity 
investments as well as bitcoin impairment losses because 
we believe these measures are useful in understanding our 
operating results without regard to gains and losses due to 
non-operating market fluctuations of our investments. We 
have included measures excluding release of transaction loss 
reserves because our transaction loss reserves experienced 
significant volatility in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the economic uncertainty it caused and we believe these 
measures are useful in understanding our operating results 
without regard to these one-time effects.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS, and non-GAAP operating 
expenses, as well as other measures defined in the 
shareholder letter, such as measures excluding bitcoin 
revenue, bitcoin impairment loss, measures excluding gains or 
losses on equity investments, and measures excluding release 
of transaction loss reserves, have limitations as financial 
measures, and should be considered as supplemental in 
nature, and are not meant as substitutes for the related 
financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We believe that the aforementioned metrics provide useful 
information about our operating results, enhance the 
overall understanding of our past performance and future 
prospects, and provide useful measures for period-to-period 
comparisons of our business, as they remove the effect 
of certain variable amounts. Our management uses these 
measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate 
future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, 
including those relating to operating expenses and the 
allocation of internal resources. 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be 
considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial 
information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These 
non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any 
standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not 
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures 
presented by other companies.
